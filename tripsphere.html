            <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create a product to give the users a better experience of booking and
                planning their travel without missing on to best deals. As most of the travel apps and websites only
                provide with either travel or stay options and also doesn't allow people to explore places locally,
                while looking for multiple options at different apps takes plenty of time. To provide a great customer
                satisfaction TripSphere Travel mobile app was designed to help potential users from booking travel
                curated by the local guides -to planning their stay -to getting recommendations and customising their
                trip within the budget.</p>

            <h2> THE PROCESS</h2>
            <p>I started off the project by researching and know more about the travel industry specially their dynamics
                in time of pandemic. The main goal was to understand who the users are,their basic requirements and pain
                points while planning for trip. To help me understand better I then followed the following process:</p>

            <h2>USER RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS</h2>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>I wanted to target users of different age group to know the process of planning the trip, organizing stay
                and
                exploring places like a local. I also wanted to focus on users who have used different apps or websites
                for
                booking their trip and understand the users behaviour and pain points around booking commutation, stay
                arrangements, recommendations for restaurants to try the local cuisine and customizing their trip
                considering the budget. </p>
            <!-- add user research goals image from figma -->
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>I conducted user interviews via zoom to understand their travel needs and preferences when it came to
                booking or planning trip. Firstly I drafted questionnaire based on my research objectives. I
                interviewd<b> 6 potential users</b> of different age groups from 25-60 years.I reocrded them with their
                consent and took notes for my reference.</p>
            <img src="../images portfolio/interview.png" alt="interview" class="interviewimage" style="width:17%">
            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>To gain more knowledge about the travel booking process I sent out survey to people targetting the
                questions about their typical booking and planning process for the trip, methods they use for research
                and how convinient they are throught the booking process. Some of the other questions were to understand
                how they go about planning trip in time of pandemic and how would I help improve their experience while
                planning trip. I collected about <b> 20 responses.</b> </p>
            <!-- add image of survey design it in figma -->
            <h3>Gathering Research Data</h3>
            <p>I then analysed all the data gathered from my user inteviews with help of affinity mapping technique and
                grouped the findings into different categories. </p>
            <img src="../images portfolio/affinitymap.png" alt="affinitymap" class="affinityMap" style="width:80%">
            <h3>Key findings gathered</h3>
            <p>I pulled out couple of key findings received from the user interviews and survey responses. </p>
            <!-- image of key findings -->
            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>As there are multiple travel apps and website available in the market, I wanted to study more about their
                features and how can I develop an app for my users considering all the pain point for which I did
                competitor analysis for the top travel companies.</p>
            <img src="../images portfolio/competitor analysis.png" alt="competitor analysis" class="competitorAnalysis"
                style="width:80%">
            <!-- also add images of the company if possiblle -->
            <h2>IDEATION AND BRAINSTORMING</h2>
            <h3>User Persona</h3>
            <p>After studying more from competitor analysis, the next phase was creating user persona and story board.
                Later I hand sketched out many possible ideas on a paper, this helped me to think of more ideas and
                iterate them. </p>
            <img src="../images portfolio/persona.png" alt="user persona" class="userPersona" style="width:50%">
            <h3>One of the many ideas</h3>
            <p>After going through many mockups, here is the final version that a travel mobile app would be an ideal
                solution considering the user pain points during the research process.</p>
            <!-- add sketch images -->
            <h3>Storyboarding</h3>
            <p>Here is the storyboard of my user persona</p>
            <img src="../images portfolio/Storyboard.png" class="storyBoarding" style="width:75%">
            <h2>WIREFRAMING AND PROTOTYPING</h2>
            <p>My next steps were to create wireframes taking in account the key findings gathered from the user
                reasearch,competitor analysis and combining them to my first low fidelity prototype. </p>
            <h3>Key Features were as follows:</h3>
            <p>1. Providing diverse options for the users in one app like booking flights, stay and locally approved
                places to explore. </p>
            <p>2. Receive daily Covid-19 updates before and also while travelling. </p>
            <p>3. Customization of travel package to suit user's budget. </p>
            <h3>Low-Fidelity prototype</h3>
            <p>I then incorpoprated the key features to the travel app and came up with the low-fidelity prototype, the
                mockup was created using figma. Here are some of the mockup screens: </p>
            <img src="../images portfolio/low-fide.png" class="lowFidelity" style="width:60%">
            <h2>TESTING AND ITERATIONS</h2>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
            <p>I conducted 4 user test on Zoom to identify if the Tripshere mobile app is interactive and whether is it
                user friendly. I also drafted tasks to perform for user testing. The users were asked to think out loud
                while performing the task to understand the user's behaviour while using the mobile app. the tasks
                assigned were as follows: </p>
            <p><b>1.</b> Login with email address, google,apple, facebook account or Sign up to Tripsphere.</p>
            <p><b>2.</b> Plan your trip and get package deals to Tokyo,Japan. </p>
            <p><b>3.</b> Customizing pre-designed itinerary to suit your budget, changing stay option in Day 1.</p>
            <p><b>4.</b> Finalising payment with card option.</p>
            <img src="../images portfolio/testing.jpg" class="testing" style="width:30%">
            <h3>Key Findings from User Testing</h3>
            <img src="../images portfolio/keyfind.png" class="keyFindings" style="width:50%">
            <h2>HI-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>
            <p>After multiple iterations made based on user testing, I designed my hi-fidelity prototype. </p>
            <img src="../images portfolio/Group 35.png" class="group1hi" style="width:75%">
            <img src="../images portfolio/Group 36.png" class="group1hi" style="width:75%">
            <h2>FINAL THOUGHTS AND FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES </h2>
            <p>As a user I never thought how much efforts and thinking goes behind designing a mobile application.
                I learned a lot from the user research and that researching and interviewing different users benefits with the design process. It is necessary to think of every design aspect as a user to make the flow easy and convenient as we have different age group of users using the mobile application.
                I realized that highlighting 1 feature is important and tend to usually go overboard adding multiple features to the app. I would like to make more features available like to the users to add their trip/save their trips for future travel.
